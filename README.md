# Python3-PROJECT-Netflix-Movies-and-Actors-Analysis

In this project, I applied basic Python skills to solve a real-world data science problem. I discovered if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I also used exploratory data analysis skills to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.
